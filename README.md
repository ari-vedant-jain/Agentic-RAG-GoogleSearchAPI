# Agentic-RAG-using-Ollama-GoogleSearchAPI
We implement a local RAG agent using LLaMA3 as the primary language model. This system is designed to retrieve relevant documents from a local vector store, generate context-aware responses, detect hallucinations, and fall back to a web search (via Google Search API) when necessary.
